      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a wireless communication systems researcher based in Edinburgh.
        I work on applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
        techniques to physical layer communications problems such as receiver design,
        channel state information compression, and positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        My recent focus is on AI-native receivers (DeepRx), MATLABâ†”Python co-execution,
        and building tools for NLP in Turkish (e.g., <a href="https://sozluk.pro/">sozluk.pro</a>).
